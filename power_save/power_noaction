# A DUMMY no-action power saving script which may serve as a template for creating your own power_save module.

# A power saving script must perform some power action, see https://bugs.schedmd.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17848
#   "17848 â€“ power_save module doesn't work for the documented "no action" suspend/resume programs"
# Author: Ole.H.Nielsen@fysik.dtu.dk
# Homepage: https://github.com/OleHolmNielsen/Slurm_tools/

# Use with ResumeProgram and SuspendProgram in slurm.conf
# NOTE: The slurmctld will execute this script as user "slurm"
# (see https://slurm.schedmd.com/power_save.html)
# so the slurm user must have credentials for suspending and resuming nodes.

# Logfile for suspend/resume actions
# NOTE: Make sure this file is writable by SlurmUser
LOGFILE=/var/log/slurm/power_noaction.log
# The slurm user must own the $LOGFILE
slurmuser="`scontrol show config | grep SlurmUser | awk '{split($3,a,"("); print a[1]}'`"

# Command usage:
function usage()
{
cat <<EOF
Usage: $0 [-r|-s|-h] nodelist
where the DUMMY action is:
	-r: Resume (start) nodes in nodelist
	-s: Suspend (stop) nodes in nodelist
	-h: Print this help information
EOF
}

# Set the power command action
action=""

	# Make sure the LOGFILE is owned by SlurmUser and has correct permissions

	# Redirect stdout and stderr to $LOGFILE
	exec &>> $LOGFILE

	# Display $action in UPPER case (see the bash man-page under Case modification)
